k-nearest-neighbours
============================


Python implementation of knn algorithm.


Description
===========

Knn is a classification method. For every input data sample it searches for k nearest training samples, using Euclidean distance.

For project's purpose the iris dataset is used, but the algorithm can be easily adapted for other kinds of data.

The project contains also tests including accuracy and running time 
comparison with knn implementation available in scikit-learn package.


Note
====

This project has been set up using PyScaffold 3.2.3. For details and usage
